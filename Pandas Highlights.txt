1. A fast and efficient DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing;

2. Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different formats: CSV and text files, Microsoft Excel, SQL databases, and the fast HDF5 format;

3. Intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data: gain automatic label-based alignment in computations and easily manipulate messy data into an orderly form;

4. Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets;

5. Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets;

6. Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for size mutability;

7. Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets;

8. High performance merging and joining of data sets;

9. Hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;

10. Time series-functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging. Even create domain-specific time offsets and join time series without losing data;
